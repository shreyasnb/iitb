\section{Introduction}

Space industry refers to economic activities related to manufacturing
components that go into outer space (Earth's orbit or beyond), delivering them
to those regions, and related services.$^{\cite{wiki:space-industry1}}$ More
broadly, the space industry can be described as the companies involved in the
space economy and providing goods and services related to
space.$^{\cite{wiki:space-industry2}}$

\subsection{Space Economy}
The Space Economy is defined by OECD as the full range of activities and the
use of resources that create value and benefits to human beings in the course
of exploring, researching, understanding, managing, and utilising
space.$^{\cite{esa:space-economy1}}$ The Space Economy is experiencing growth
and transformation in tandem with advancements in the space sector and its
deeper integration into society and the economy. Currently, the existing space
infrastructure facilitates the emergence of novel services, thereby enabling
the exploration of new applications across various sectors such as meteorology,
energy, telecommunications, insurance, transportation, maritime operations,
aviation, and urban development. This fosters additional economic and societal
benefits. Not only is the space sector expanding on its own, but it also serves
as a crucial driver of growth in other sectors.$^{\cite{esa:space-economy2}}$

\section{Literature Review}
Table \ref{tab:estimates} contains estimates of the size of the space economy taken from various recent publications. According to some financial estimates, the space economy may surpass USD 1 trillion by 2040. The estimates are based on different methodologies and assumptions, and the differences between them are significant. The great discrepancy in estimates is therefore largely due to the use of different definitions and delimitations of the space economy. In particular, the inclusion or exclusion of services supporting
consumer markets such as direct-to-home television, and consumer applications relying on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals, etc.

\subsection{Role of the government sector in space economy}

The government sector plays a key role in the space economy as investor, developer, owner, operator, regulator and customer. National agencies, research centres and laboratories also perform space R\&D and, in some cases, have a manufacturing role (e.g. India, Korea). The bulk of their funding tends to be public, but they may also receive private financing via contracts and licensing arrangements etc. The international classification of actors involved in R\&D, as described in the Frascati Manual, is often used to gather comparable data concerning the R\&D activities of governments.

    \caption{Measured as a share of GDP in 2020}
    \label{fig:space-gdp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:space-gdp} shows the share of GDP spent on space activities in 2020. The United States, Russia, and France are the top three countries in terms of space spending as a share of GDP. The United States is the largest spender on space activities, accounting for 0.25\% of its GDP. Russia and France are the second and third largest spenders, accounting for 0.22\% and 0.12\% of their GDP, respectively.

\subsection{Global Space Interests - Trends and Forecasts}

    \label{fig:space-interests}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:space-interests} shows the space expenditures of countries in 2021 while Figure \ref{fig:korea-space-gdp} shows the gross domestic expenditure on space R\&D by sector in a developing country like Korea.

    \caption{Gross domestic expenditure on space R\&D by sector in Korea}
    \label{fig:korea-space-gdp}
\end{figure}

Countries like India, China, and Korea are increasing their space spending, and the space economy is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. According to IN-SPace in this report \cite{news:thehindu}, the space economy of India is expected to grow to USD 44 billion by 2033, with about 8\% of global share.

\section{Observations}

In today's race to space, countries seem to be coming together to work on global problems in space. The space industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, and the space economy is expected to reach USD 1 trillion by 2040. While the government sector plays a significant role in the space economy, private space companies are a booming industry, especially in countries like India, China, and Korea. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The United States and Japan and their private moon landings \cite{news:nikkeiasia}. 
    \item SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other private space companies are leading the way in space exploration and are expected to play a significant role in the future of the space economy.
    \item Lunar exploration is expected to be a significant part of the space economy in the coming years, with countries like India having ambitious plans like the Chandrayaan-3 mission.
\end{itemize}
